Changelog
=========

1.0b2 (unreleased)
------------------

* Added German translation.


1.0b1 (2010-07-08)
------------------

* Tests no longer use `IBaseContent` from ``dolmen.content``.

* Added translations (French).


0.2 (2010-02-26)
----------------

* The Breadcrumbs now uses an adaptation to the ``zope.dublincore``
  `IDCDescriptiveProperties` interface in order to provide a name. The
  base multi adapter is registered for
  ``zope.location`` `ILocation`. Therefore, the Breadcrumbs is no longer
  limited to ``dolmen.content`` `IBaseContent` components.

* The dependencies have been greatly cleaned. We are now using a ``Grok
  1.1rc1`` version of the ZTK. We no longer depend on zope.app packages.

* Updated the IAbsoluteUrl component to match the changes in
  ``zope.traversing``. The View has been removed and replace by a
  simple MultiAdapter providing IAbsoluteUrl.


0.1 (2009-11-08)
----------------
